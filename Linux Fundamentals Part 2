Welcome to the second part of the reworked "Linux Fundamentals" series. We'll be applying our knowledge from the first installment in this series, so I highly recommend you completing that room before proceeding further.

In part 2, we'll be ditching the in-browser functionality and help you get started in what is a fundamental skill in being able to login to and control the terminals of remote machines. Not only this, but the room will also have you:

Unlocking the potential of your first few commands by introducing you to using flags and arguments
Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem to perform some more useful commands such as copying and moving files
Introducing you to the access mechanisms in place to keep files and folders secure and how to identify the things that our current user has access too
Running your first few scripts and executables!

Task-1

Let's proceed!
> No answer needed

Task-2

I've logged into the Linux Fundamentals Part 2 machine using SSH!
> No answer needed

Task-3

Explore the manual page of the ls command
> No answer needed
What directional arrow key would we use to navigate down the manual page?
> down
What flag would we use to display the output in a "human-readable" way?
> -h

Task-4

How would you create the file named "newnote"?
> touch newnote
On the deployable machine, what is the file type of "unknown1" in "tryhackme's" home directory?
> ASCII text
How would we move the file "myfile" to the directory "myfolder" 
> mv myfile myfolder
What are the contents of this file?
> THM{FILESYSTEM}
Continue to apply your knowledge and practice the commands from this task.
> No answer needed

Task-5

On the deployable machine, who is the owner of "important"?
> user2
What would the command be to switch to the user "user2"?
> su user2
Now switch to this user "user2" using the password "user2"
> No answer needed
Output the contents of "important", what is the flag?
> THM{SU_USER2}

Task-6

Read me!
> No answer needed
What is the directory path that would we expect logs to be stored in?
> /var/log
What root directory is similar to how RAM on a computer works?
> /tmp
Name the home directory of the root user 
> /root
Now apply your learning and navigate through these directories on the deployed Linux machine.
> No answer needed

Task-7

Proceed to the next task to continue your learning
> No answer needed

Task-8

Terminate the machine from task 2!
> No answer needed
Join Linux Fundamentals Part 3!
